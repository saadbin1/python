Titanic Survival Prediction:
Use the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, 
gender, class, etc. You can use machine learning algorithms like logistic regression or decision trees for this project.

Iris Flower Classification:
Use the Iris flower dataset to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal dimensions.
 You can use algorithms like k-nearest neighbors or support vector machines for this project.

Sentiment Analysis:
Perform sentiment analysis on a collection of text data to determine whether the sentiment expressed is positive, 
negative, or neutral. You can use pre-trained models like VADER or implement your own using techniques like bag-of-words or word embeddings.

Image Classification:
Build an image classification model to classify images into different categories. You can use popular deep learning 
libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch and pre-trained models like ResNet or VGGNet to accomplish this task.

Customer Segmentation:
Analyze customer data and segment them into different groups based on their demographics, behavior, or purchase history. 
You can use clustering algorithms like k-means or hierarchical clustering for this project.
